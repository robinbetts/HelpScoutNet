To add the attachment to a new conversation

```csharp
 var newConv = client.CreateConversation(new Conversation
  {
      ...
      Threads = new List<Thread>{
                        new Thread
                        {
                            ...
                            Attachments = new List<Attachment>
                            {
                                new Attachment
                                {
                                    Hash = fileHash
                                }
                            }
                        }
                     }
               });
               
```


###Field Selectors 

Each endpoint returns a default set of fields based upon the given request. However, you can override this behavior by supplying one or more field selectors to explicitly request the data you need.

Instead of returning a complete customer object, you could return just the ID and lastname.

```csharp

client.GetCustomer(123, new CustomerRequest {Fields = new[] {"id", "lastName"}});
  
```
